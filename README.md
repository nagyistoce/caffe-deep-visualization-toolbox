# Deep Visualization Toolbox Installation



### Step 0: Compile master branch of caffe (optional)

Get the master branch of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) to compile on your
machine. If you've never used Caffe before, it can take a bit of time to get all the required libraries in place. Fortunately, the [installation process is well documented](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html). When you're installing OpenCV, install the Python bindings as well (see Step 2 below).

Note: You can set `CPU_ONLY := 1` in your `Makefile.config` to skip all the Cuda/GPU stuff. The Deep Visualization Toolbox can run with Caffe in either CPU or GPU mode.



### Step 1: Compile the deconv-deep-vis-toolbox branch of caffe

Instead of using the master branch of caffe, to use the demo
you'll need a slightly modified branch (supporting deconv and a few
extra Python bindings). Getting the branch and switching to it is easy.
Starting from your caffe directory, run:

    $ git remote add yosinski https://github.com/yosinski/caffe.git
    $ git fetch --all
    $ git checkout --track -b deconv-deep-vis-toolbox yosinski/deconv-deep-vis-toolbox
    $ make clean
    $ make -j
    $ make -j pycaffe

As noted above, feel free to compile in `CPU_ONLY` mode if desired.



### Step 2: Install python-opencv

You may have already installed the `python-opencv` bindings as part of the Caffe setup process. If `import cv2` works from Python, then you're all set. If not, install the bindings like this:

Linux:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-opencv

Mac using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (if desired, add option `--with-tbb` to enable parallel code using Intel TBB):

    $ brew install opencv

Other install options on Mac may also work well.



### Step 3: Download and configure Deep Visualization Toolbox code

You can put it wherever you like:

    $ git clone https://github.com/nagyistoce/caffe-deep-visualization-toolbox
    $ cd deep_visualization_toolbox

Copy `settings.py.template` to `settings.py` and edit it so the `caffevis_caffe_root` variable points to the directory where you've compiled caffe in Step 1:

    $ cp settings.py.template settings.py
    $ < edit settings.py >

Download the example model weights and corresponding top-9 visualizations saved as jpg (downloads a 230MB model and 1.1GB of jpgs to show as visualization):

    $ cd models/caffenet-yos/
    $ ./fetch.sh



### Step 4: Run it!

Simple:

    $ ./run_toolbox.py

Once the toolbox is running, push 'h' to show a help screen. You can also have a look at `bindings.py` to see what the various keys do. If the window is too large or too small for your screen, set the `global_scale` variable in `settings.py` to a value smaller or larger than one.




## Troubleshooting
